# DA-Captsone-Project-


##Overview:
  This project explores how programming languages and databases are used across different countries, highlighting key trends in both current adoption and future demand. By analyzing survey data, we break down   the most popular technologies by region, identify shifts in developer preferences, and uncover emerging trends. Using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, we extracted, cleaned, and analyzed large datasets   to generate insights into how technology stacks vary globally. The findings provide valuable context for developers, businesses, and hiring managers looking to stay ahead in an evolving tech landscape.

##Project Summary: Global Trends in Programming Languages & Databases
  This project analyzes global trends in programming language and database usage, focusing on current adoption and future demand across different countries. Using data from the IBM Data Analyst Certification course, we identified key insights into developer preferences, highlighting dominant technologies, emerging trends, and regional variations.

  Key Findings:
  -  Programming Languages: JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS remain dominant, while Rust and Go are gaining traction, indicating a shift toward modern, performance-driven development.

  - Database Usage: PostgreSQL leads in adoption, while Redis is rapidly growing in demand. Supabase is emerging as a strong open-source alternative to Firebase.

  - Regional Trends: The U.S. leads in both current use and future adoption, but countries like India, Germany, and Brazil also play a significant role in shaping trends.

  Implications:
  Developers and businesses are prioritizing scalable, high-performance technologies, driving a shift toward open-source solutions and specialized database architectures.

##Future Improvements
  With more time, I would expand the analysis by incorporating additional factors like education level,         career level, and learning resources used by respondents. This would provide deeper insights into how         different backgrounds influence technology adoption and skill development. Understanding these trends could   help companies and educators tailor their strategies for training, recruitment, and upskilling efforts.
